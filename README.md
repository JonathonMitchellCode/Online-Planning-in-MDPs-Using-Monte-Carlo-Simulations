# Online-Planning-in-MDPs-Using-Monte-Carlo-Simulations
This repository contains my implementation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm applied to the classic game of Tic Tac Toe. Explore how MCTS optimizes decision-making in game scenarios. The codebase includes a random number generator for simulating opponent moves, performance statistics, and more.
